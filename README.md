## Your path to there
1. [Set up](challenges.0.md) your system.
2. Accomplish the [Single Loop Challenge](challenges.1.md) and learn about container basics and Azure Container Instances for single container applications.
3. Do the [Kubernetes 101 Challenges](challenges.2.md) and learn about Kubernetes basic concepts (pods and services),deploy a container to your cluster and make it available in the internet.
4. Face [the Kubernetes Multicontainer Challenge](challenges.3.md) and deploy a complex multi container application update with zero downtime using an end to end DevOps pipeline automated by VSTS by using Kubernetes deployments.
5. Professionalize your operations using insights in the [Operations and Application Insights Challenge](challenges.4md). Upgrade your application with another backend implementation written in Go, meassure the performance, reason about the performance metrics using Application Insights and if the new version is not good enough perform a rollback - without downtime.
